# FluidigmILCdata
Scripts and files required for analysing the Fluidigm 48.48 Biomark gene expression data.

Supplementary Data 1: p values from Fisher's Exact Test for proportion of cells expressing each gene of interest.

Supplementary Data 2: p values from ANOVA performed on route comparison data and i.m. only comparison data.

Supplementary Data 3: p values comparing each vaccination condition and the coexpression combinations of Stat3, Stat6, Tgfb1, and Ifngr1.

ILC analysis script rm MVA: Statistical analysis of the i.n. FPV, i.n. Ad5, i.m. FPV and i.m. Ad5 conditions.

ILC analysis script i.m. only:  Statistical analysis of the i.m. FPV, i.m. Ad5 and i.m. MVA conditions.

ggplot rm MVA: Generates PCA plots for i.n. FPV, i.n. Ad5, i.m. FPV and i.m. Ad5 conditions.

ggplot i.m. only: Generates PCA plots for i.m. FPV, i.m. Ad5 and i.m. MVA conditions.

Clustering analysis: Generates PCA plots, k-means clusters and co-expression combination groups with respect to Stat3, Stat6, Tgfb1 and Ifngr1.
